java wait : thread.speel() - blind waits - here it waits for the time which we mension

selenium wait : - intellegent waits - here it check every 500ms

	*implicit : it is used for all findElement and findElements() | use before driver.get() | if element is not found the it gives no suchElement Exception
 | can be given in ms,s,min,hr,day | driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofseconds(10));
 
	*explicit : it is used for all e;ements,pages | this operates on condition | default polling period is 500ms | we get Timeout exception is the condition is not satisfied in the specified condtion | when to use it : when element is not clickeble(elementClickIntercepted),when element is not visible(elementNotInteractabel)
	
	*fluent : here we can change the polling period
	
	
POM classes in JAVA
	-element modification is easy
	-UI changes can be handled easily
	-element reusablity
	-avoid element hardcoding in the test scripts
	
	element indentification using : @FindBy,@FindBYs,@findAll
	
	rules to create a POM class
		-create separate POM class for every webpage
		-find all the element by @FindBy annotation and make web element as private
		-create the constructor and initilization of these web elements
		-provide the getters to access these web element
		
		
Testing : 
for testing we cannot use the main method in java, instead we have to use other method for example we can create a method called "@Test public void sample()"

Validations in testing

testing is comparision between actual and expected output

assertion : 
	there are 2 types of assertion
			1.hard assert : static methods - assert.assertEquals(),assertNotEquals(),asserTrue(),assertFalse(),assertSame(),assertNotSame() | mandatory informatios | it hard assert fails then it fails and it throws the assertion exception 
			2.soft assert : non-static methods - SoftAssert sa = new SoftAssert(); , sa.assertEquals(), same methods as above | if softassert fails then it will not stop the execution and it will contimue and log the assertion failures at the end
